## 📝 Copy-Paste Prompt for AI

```
I need help creating a PowerPoint presentation for my Campus Companion project. I have complete documentation but need it formatted as PowerPoint slides with concise bullet points and visual suggestions.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Campus Companion is an AI-powered campus management web application built with MERN stack featuring:
- Event Management & Registration
- AI-powered Lost & Found (with item matching)
- Community Discussion Hub
- Placement & Career Services
- AI Resume Analyzer (using OpenAI GPT-4)
- User Authentication & Role-based Access

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
- Frontend: React 18.2.0 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4
- Storage: Cloudinary
- Deployment: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)

I NEED SLIDES FOR:

1. SRS (Software Requirements Specification) - 7-10 slides
2. DFD (Data Flow Diagrams) - 5-7 slides

I ALREADY HAVE:
- UI Prototype (will demonstrate live)
- Working application for demo

FOR EACH SLIDE, PLEASE PROVIDE:
1. Slide Title
2. Concise bullet points (3-5 points max per slide)
3. Visual suggestion (diagram type, icons, or layout idea)
4. Speaker notes (what to say - 1-2 sentences)

REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep text minimal and impactful
- Use technical but clear language
- Highlight AI features prominently
- Include statistics where impressive (98.6% test pass rate, <500ms response time)
- Make it suitable for 15-20 minute presentation
- Focus on technical depth and innovation

Please structure the output as:

---
SLIDE X: [Title]

Content:
• Bullet point 1
• Bullet point 2
• Bullet point 3

Visual: [Suggestion for diagram/icon/layout]

Speaker Notes: [What to say when presenting this slide]
---

START WITH THE SRS SECTION FIRST, THEN DFD SECTION.

For SRS, emphasize:
- Problem statement and objectives
- Key functional requirements (especially AI features)
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security)
- System interfaces (MongoDB, OpenAI, Cloudinary)
- User roles and access control

For DFD, include:
- Context diagram explanation
- Level 1 diagram with 6 main processes
- Focus on 1-2 detailed Level 2 flows (especially Resume Analyzer or Lost & Found AI matching)
- Data stores
- External entities

Make it professional, technical, and impressive for an academic presentation.

Begin with a title slide and introduction, then proceed with SRS slides, followed by DFD slides.
